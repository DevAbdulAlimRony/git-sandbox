- .git folder:
    1. config folder: Customizing git, Configuring global settings like our name and email across all git repos, but we can also configure things on a per-repo basis.
    - git config --local user.name
    - changing info, error color and so on.

    2. Refs Folder: Inside of refs, you will find a head directory. It contains one file for a branch and contains the hash of the commit at the tip of the branch.
    More - remotes, origin, tags folder

    3. HEAD File: It points to the commit instead of branch

    4. Objects Folder: The objects directory contains all the repo files. This is where git stores the backups of files, the commits in a repo and more. The fils are all compressed and encrypted, so they won't look like much.
    4 different types of object-  commit, tree, blob, annotated tag

- Hashing Function: 40 characters long. They take inputs of variable size and output as fixed size. Git uses a hashing function SHA-1. Just check: echo "something" | git hash-object --stdin

- Git Database: Git is a key value store.

- Git blobs(binary large object) are the object type Git uses to store the contents of files in a given repository.

- Tree: Tress are git objects used to store the contents of a directory. Each tree contains pointers that can refer  to blobs and to other trees.

- View Trees: git cat-file -p master^{tree}

- git-cat-file prints git objects

- Commit objects combine a tree object along with information about the context that led to the current tree.
